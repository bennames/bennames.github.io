AeroComBAT Tutorials
====================

The following are tutorials intended convey how best to use AeroComBAT.

Tutorial 1 - Material Library and Classical Lamination Theory
-------------------------------------------------------------
This tutorial is intended to expose the user to the material library class as
well as creating CLT laminates with the laminate class. Note that these
laminate objects are integral to meshing the cross-section (XSect) objects.

Tutorial 2 - CQUADX and Airfoil Classes
---------------------------------------

This tutorial is intended to expose the user to the CQUADX and airfoil classes.

Tutorial 3 - Cross-Section Meshing and Analysis
-----------------------------------------------

This is the first extensive tutorial. It exposes the user to meshing several
different cross-section types, all with varying complexities.

Tutorial 4 - Using Superbeams to Conduct Simple Beam Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------

This tutorial exposes users to conducting beam analysis using the SuperBeam
class. It also exposes users to the Model class for the first time.

Tutorial 5 - Creating a Wing and Conducting a Flutter Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------

This tutorial exposes users to creating a wing and conducting flutter analysis
on it. Note that every analysis a superbeam can conduct can also be conducted
on a wing.
